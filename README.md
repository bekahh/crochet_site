## Bekah's Crochet Creations

This is a website I've built to display my crochet projects.

Live version here: https://bekahh.github.io/crochet_site/.

This page is responsive to mobile and tablet size screens. Resizing the screen smaller will display less columns.
For desktop screens, there is an image overlay that is visible when hovering over the images.

The form has front-end validation to ensure all fields are filled. Try it out!
